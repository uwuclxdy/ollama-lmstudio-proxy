- Method: `POST`
- Endpoint: `/v1/systemone`
- See llama.cpp docs: [System One API](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/server/README.md#post-v1systemone-typesafe-compatible-system-one-api)

Use the identifier of a [loaded decision model](/docs/developer/rest/load), not a regular chat model.

Provide `state` and a `questions` object keyed by question ID. Question types are `noul` (probability that a condition is true), `choice` (select from a `criteria` object), and `score` (rate against an ordered `criteria` array). Responses contain an `answers` object keyed by question ID.

Images must be inline base64 data URLs and require a model that supports image input.

##### cURL

```bash
curl http://localhost:1234/v1/systemone \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "your-decision-model",
    "state": "I was charged twice.",
    "questions": {
      "angry": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Is the customer angry?"}
    }
  }'
```
