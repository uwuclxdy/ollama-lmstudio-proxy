##### Python example

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1", api_key="lm-studio")

decision = client.decisions.create(
  model="model-identifier",
  input="I was charged twice.",
  questions=[
    {"type": "predicate", "name": "angry", "instructions": "Is the customer angry?"}
  ],
)

print(decision.answers)
```

Requires OpenAI Python 3.26.0+.
