title: Get Model Info
description: Get information about the model
---

You can access general information and metadata about a model itself from a loaded
instance of that model.

In the below examples, the LLM reference can be replaced with an
embedding model reference without requiring any other changes.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.llm()

        print(model.get_info())

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model()

            print(model.get_info())

    "Python (asynchronous API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        # Note: assumes use of an async function or the "python -m asyncio" asynchronous REPL
        # Requires Python SDK version 1.5.0 or later
        import lmstudio as lms

        async with lms.AsyncClient() as client:
            model = await client.llm.model()

            print(await model.get_info())

```

## Example output

```python
LlmInstanceInfo.from_dict({
  "architecture": "qwen2",
  "contextLength": 4096,
  "displayName": "Qwen2.5 7B Instruct 1M",
  "format": "gguf",
