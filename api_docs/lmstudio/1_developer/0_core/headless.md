LM Studio can be run as a background service without the GUI. There are two ways to do this:

1. **llmster** (recommended) — a standalone daemon, no GUI required
2. **Desktop app in headless mode** — hide the UI and run the desktop app as a service

## Option 1: llmster (recommended)

llmster is the core of the LM Studio desktop app, packaged to be server-native, without reliance on the GUI. It can run on Linux boxes, cloud servers, GPU rigs, or your local machine without the GUI. See the [LM Studio 0.4.0 release post](/blog/0.4.0) for more details.

### Install llmster

**Linux / Mac**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://lmstudio.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows**

```bash
irm https://lmstudio.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Start llmster

```bash
lms daemon up
```

See the [daemon CLI docs](/docs/cli/daemon/daemon-up) for full reference.

For setting up llmster as a startup task on Linux, see [Linux Startup Task](/docs/developer/core/headless_llmster).

## Option 2: Desktop app in headless mode

This works on Mac, Windows, and Linux machines with a graphical user interface. It's useful if you already have the desktop app installed and want it to run as a background service.

### Run the LLM service on machine login

Head to app settings (`Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `,`) and check the box to run the LLM server on login.

When this setting is enabled, exiting the app will minimize it to the system tray, and the LLM server will continue to run in the background.

### Auto Server Start

Your last server state will be saved and restored on app or service launch.

To achieve this programmatically:

```bash
lms server start
```

## Just-In-Time (JIT) model loading for REST endpoints

Applies to both options. Useful when using LM Studio as an LLM service with other frontends or applications.

#### When JIT loading is ON:

- Calls to OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` will return all downloaded models, not only the ones loaded into memory
- Calls to inference endpoints will load the model into memory if it's not already loaded

#### When JIT loading is OFF:

- Calls to OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` will return only the models loaded into memory
- You have to first load the model into memory before being able to use it

#### What about auto unloading?

JIT loaded models will be auto-unloaded from memory by default after a set period of inactivity ([learn more](/docs/developer/core/ttl-and-auto-evict)).
